# Greedy Coloring Algorithm - Graph Theory

In graph theory, graph coloring is a special case of graph labeling: it is an assignment of labels traditionally called "colors" to elements of a graph subject to certain constraints. In its simplest form , it is a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color; this is called a vertex coloring. Similarly, an edge coloring assigns a color to each edge so that no two adjacent edges share the same color, and a face coloring of a planar graph assigns a color to each face or region so that no two faces that share a boundary have the same color.
